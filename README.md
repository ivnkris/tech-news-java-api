# Tech News Java API

## Description

In this project I have created a full-stack web application for a tech news board using the Spring Java framework with Spring MVC to create RESTful API routes, Spring Session for managing user's session information, Spring Security for authentication and authorization and Thymeleaf Layout Dialect to create layouts and reusable templates.

- [x] Created REST and Java Controllers
